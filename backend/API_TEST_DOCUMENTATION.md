### Authentication Testing
- ✅ Protected endpoints require authentication
- ✅ Role-specific endpoints enforce proper authorization
- ✅ Public endpoints accessible without authentication

## Running Tests

### Individual Test Classes
```bash
# Run application context test
mvn test -Dtest=EduPressBackendApplicationTest

# Run lesson controller tests
mvn test -Dtest=LessonControllerTest

# Run integration tests
mvn test -Dtest=AllControllersIntegrationTest

# Run API availability tests
mvn test -Dtest=ApiEndpointAvailabilityTest
```

### All Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run tests with coverage
mvn test jacoco:report
```

### Test with specific profile
```bash
mvn test -Dspring.profiles.active=test
```

## Expected Test Results

### Success Criteria
1. **Application Context**: Loads without errors
2. **Endpoint Availability**: All endpoints return non-404 status codes
3. **Security**: Role-based access control working correctly
4. **CRUD Operations**: All basic operations functional
5. **Business Logic**: Complex operations (like lesson completion, assignment submission) working

### Test Status Summary
- ✅ **Application Startup**: PASS
- ✅ **Endpoint Mapping**: PASS
- ✅ **Security Configuration**: PASS
- ✅ **Database Integration**: PASS
- ✅ **Service Layer**: PASS
- ✅ **Controller Layer**: PASS

## Notes for Developers

### Test Data
- Tests use H2 in-memory database
- Mock data is created in each test setup
- No real external dependencies required

### Adding New Tests
1. Create test class in appropriate package under `src/test/java`
2. Use `@SpringBootTest` for integration tests
3. Use `@WebMvcTest` for controller unit tests
4. Add test-specific configuration to `application-test.properties`

### Test Coverage
The test suite covers:
- All controller endpoints
- Security configurations
- Basic service functionality
- Database integration
- Application startup and configuration

This comprehensive test suite ensures that all APIs are working correctly and the backend is ready for frontend integration.
